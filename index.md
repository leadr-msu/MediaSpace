You have many options to choose from, but the one that best balances privacy with being able to post video or audio to a LEADR-hosted site is the one labeled MSU Sites. Make sure to click Ok when finished

If there is a warning message, this is to alert you that, by putting this code on another webpage, the video will no longer be protected by MediaSpace's login requirements.

Copy all the code in the box. Before copying the code, yo ucan change any of the options related to the video player, auto-sizing, etc.

Finally, paste the code into the webpage code on your own website and you're done!
